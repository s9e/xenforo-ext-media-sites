If media site is disabled:
 - prevent overloading at posting
 - prevent rendering

Toggle:
 - globally?
 - per-site?

Behaviour when using the Add Media button in editor?
-> It creates a [MEDIA] tag.

Behaviour when "Do not auto-embed links from this site" is enabled?
-> It creates a [URL] tag without the mediasite attribute.

Implement the feature as a new choice for the autoEmbedMedia config? Complicated, and XenForo uses hardcoded magic values (1, 2, 3) to represent the option's state.


Side-effects:
 - May not obey the max media limit per message? Seems like it does.
 - Links pasted in XFMG?

Consider using [MEDIA=youtube url=https://...]...[/MEDIA]

Media embeds appear as links in the rich text editor if unfurl is disabled.
-> The embed will be reparsed every time the post is edited. Potential issues with media sites that require scraping but low risk overall.

Unfurl only applies to URLs that are alone on a line but links created by this feature can have unfurl blocks anywhere.
